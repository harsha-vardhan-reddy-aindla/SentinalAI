## 🌟 Key Features

### 🛡️ 1. Citizen Safety Portal & Spatial Map
- **Interactive Google Maps Layering:** Seamlessly switches between Google Maps Light Roadmap, Google Satellite, and Sentinel Dark tile layers.
- **50+ Live Telemetry Map Pins:** Renders historical and real-time incident pins, dark streetlight zones, police precinct stations, hospitals, 4K CCTV camera arrays, and citizen safe havens across Greater Hyderabad.
- **Real-Time Safety Score Engine:** Calculates deterministic risk scores (0–100) based on kernel density incident risk, active streetlight ratios, CCTV coverage, and station proximity.
- **OSRM Road Network Routing:** Computes turn-by-turn road network geometry comparing **Direct Shortest Road Route** vs **Recommended Safe Road Corridor** (*detouring via well-lit arterial avenues & police patrol corridors*).

### 📣 2. Low-Friction Citizen Incident Reporting
- **Multi-Modal Location Selection:** Set incident locations via **🎯 Live GPS Location Detection**, **📍 Hyderabad Landmark Search**, or **🗺️ Interactive Map Point Click**.
- **Automated PII Redaction Guardrails:** Express backend automatically scrubs personally identifiable information (phone numbers, email addresses, names) before saving records.
- **Live Synchronized Community Feed:** Citizen reports are instantly synchronized across the Citizen Portal and Police Command Center.

### 🚓 3. Police Tactical Command & Operations Center
- **Emergency Patrol Unit Dispatch Console:** Dispatches the nearest active patrol unit (`PATROL-401`, `PATROL-402`, etc.) to high-severity citizen incidents in real time.
- **Active Patrol Fleet Console:** Live fleet tracking with commander info, status indicators (`ON PATROL`, `DISPATCHED`, `STANDBY`), and instant sector reassignment.
- **Gemini AI Shift Patrol Optimizer:** Computes sector risk index math and synthesizes operational shift briefings.
- **Incident Triage Queue:** Filter, verify, dismiss, or resolve reported hazards.

### 🔒 4. Strict Security & Role-Based Separation
- **Citizen Portal:** Authenticates via Mobile Phone Number + 6-Digit SMS OTP Verification + Profile Details (*Full Name, Age, Gender*).
- **Police Command Portal:** Gated behind official Police Credentials (*Badge ID & Password*). Unauthenticated or citizen access is blocked with a 403 Forbidden screen.
